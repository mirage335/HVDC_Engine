__Usage__
Various sources and loads can be adapted to HVDC grids of arbitrary voltage and scale, from 5V to upwards of 1kV. Specialized PWM controller minimizes noise while generating gate drive voltages.

__Design__
Top-Level schematics and PCB layouts are reference high-power converter designs. Deeply modular, functional subsystems carry out most basic functions (PWM, startup regulation, gate driving).

USA companies provide all parts in these schematics, excepting the following alternative isolation transformers:
$7.65 MOUSER 631-IT143
$14.52 MOUSER 631-IT312
$9.00 MOUSER 631-IT258

__Future__
A 3D printable air-core toroid transformer will be added after testing.

__Safety__
Great power, great responsibility... to be cautious. This circuitry is a starting point for DC power conversion systems, up to extremely high power, which must be backed up by appropriate protection against fault, fire, etc.

Additionally, while everything is basically expected to work, nothing has been tested yet, certainly not at high power. In general, as engineering tools, these files are not intended to be used as-is.
